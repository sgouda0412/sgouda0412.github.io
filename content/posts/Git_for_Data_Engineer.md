Git is an indispensable tool for data engineers managing code, configurations, and data pipelines. This guide covers essential Git commands with practical examples tailored for data workflows.

## 🔍 `git diff` - Inspecting Changes

**📌 Use case:** Review modifications before staging or committing

```bash
# Show unstaged changes
git diff

# Compare staged changes with last commit
git diff --cached

# Compare between two branches
git diff main..feature-branch

# Check changes to specific file
git diff data_pipeline.py
```

For data engineers, `git diff` is particularly useful when:

- 🔄 Reviewing changes to SQL scripts
- 📊 Comparing different versions of data transformation logic
- ⚙️ Checking modifications to configuration files

## ↩️ `git revert` - Safe Undo

**📌 Use case:** Create a new commit that undoes a previous commit

```bash
# Revert a specific commit
git revert abc1234

# Revert the last commit
git revert HEAD
```

💡 Key points:
- 🛡️ Doesn't rewrite history (safe for shared branches)
- ✨ Creates a new commit with inverse changes
- 🚀 Ideal for fixing production issues without disrupting commit history

## ⏮️ `git reset` - Rewriting History

**📌 Use case:** Remove commits from branch history

```bash
# Soft reset (keeps changes in staging)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Mixed reset (keeps changes unstaged)
git reset HEAD~1

# Hard reset (discards changes completely)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

🔧 Data engineering scenarios:
- `--soft`: When you want to recommit with additional changes
- `--hard`: When you need to completely discard experimental changes

⚠️ **Warning:** Only use `--hard` on local branches, never on shared branches

## 🧹 `git rebase` - Clean History

**📌 Use case:** Maintain linear project history

```bash
# Rebase current branch onto main
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase (last 3 commits)
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

🎯 Benefits for data pipelines:
- 🧼 Eliminates unnecessary merge commits
- 🧩 Allows squashing related changes
- 🔍 Makes bisecting easier for debugging pipeline issues

## 📦 `git stash` - Temporary Storage

**📌 Use case:** Switch contexts without committing

```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash

# Stash with message
git stash save "WIP: data validation"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash
git stash pop

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{2}
```

💼 Perfect for when you need to:
- 🔄 Quickly switch branches to fix a production issue
- 🧪 Test someone else's changes without committing your WIP
- 🧹 Temporarily remove changes to run clean tests

## 🍒 `git cherry-pick` - Selective Commits

**📌 Use case:** Apply specific commits to another branch

```bash
git checkout main
git cherry-pick abc1234
```

📊 Data engineering applications:
- 🚑 Porting hotfixes between release branches
- 🏭 Moving specific pipeline improvements to production
- 🧪 Extracting experimental changes from feature branches

## 🏷️ `git tag` - Version Markers

**📌 Use case:** Mark important milestones

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"

# Push tags to remote
git push origin v1.2.0

# List tags
git tag -l
```

🚀 Essential for data pipeline management:
- 🏭 Tagging production releases
- 📈 Marking dataset versions
- 🤖 Identifying model training checkpoints

## 🧩 `git submodules` - Component Management

**📌 Use case:** Include external repositories

```bash
# Add a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/team/shared-utils.git

# Clone repo with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/user/data-project.git

# Update submodules
git submodule update --remote
```

🔧 Common data engineering uses:
- 📚 Incorporating shared data validation libraries
- 🏗️ Managing common pipeline components across projects
- 🧠 Version-controlling machine learning model repositories

## 🚀 Putting It All Together: Sample Workflow

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout -b feature-data-cleaning

# Make changes
vim cleaning_script.py

# Stash temporary work
git stash save "WIP: outlier detection"

# Pull latest changes from main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feature-data-cleaning
git rebase main

# Continue working
git stash pop

# Commit and push
git add cleaning_script.py
git commit -m "Implement robust data cleaning"
git push origin feature-data-cleaning

# Tag release
git tag -a v1.3.0-beta -m "Beta release for testing"
git push origin v1.3.0-beta
```

🌟 **Pro Tip:** Create aliases for frequently used commands in your `~/.gitconfig`:

```gitconfig
[alias]
    st = status
    ci = commit
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    lg = log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit
```

Mastering these Git commands will significantly improve your efficiency as a data engineer, enabling better collaboration and more reliable data pipeline management.
